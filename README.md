# Recursive Directory Creator Script

This Bash script allows you to create a directory structure with nested subdirectories and files interactively.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this script to your local machine.

2. Make the script executable, if needed:
   chmod +x mkdir_recursive.sh  #please delete (the .txt file extention) 
Run the script:


./mkdir_recursive.sh
Follow the prompts to create your directory structure:

Enter the top-level directory name.
Enter the names of files you want to create.
Enter the names of subdirectories you want to create.
The script will create the specified directories and files with the given structure.

Customization
You can customize the script by modifying the max_depth variable to control the maximum depth of subdirectories created.


max_depth=3  # Change this to your desired maximum depth
